# Service Endpoint Mapping Configuration
# Maps plugin types to their corresponding service endpoints

# NLP Service Endpoints (nlp-service:8001)
nlp_endpoints:
  conceptnet: "providers/conceptnet/expand"
  gensim: "providers/gensim/expand"  # Use generic provider endpoint instead of specialized similarity
  spacy_temporal: "providers/spacy/expand"  # Use 'spacy' provider name, not 'spacy_temporal'
  heideltime: "providers/heideltime/expand"
  sutime: "providers/sutime/expand"
  # Add more NLP endpoints as needed

# LLM Service Endpoints (llm-service:8002)
llm_endpoints:
  keywords: "expand"  # Use general expand endpoint, not specialized keywords/expand
  general: "expand"
  # Add more LLM endpoints as needed

# Plugin to Service Mapping Rules
plugin_routing:
  # Pattern-based routing (case-insensitive)
