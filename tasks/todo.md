# Complete Redo: Elegant Media Intelligence System for (in future) prompt based search

- building a hybrid llm/nlp/literal media search engine that only offers suggestions from its real-world-data db

## Core Philosophy

**NO HARD-CODING ANYWHERE** - Everything procedural, intelligent, and data-driven.

**Two Types of Intelligence:**
1. **Ingestion Plugins** - Enrich raw media data (movies, future: TV/books/music) using NLP/LLM
2. **Query Plugins** - Intelligently understand user search intent using same NLP/LLM tools
3. **Dual-Use Plugins** - Same intelligence for both ingestion and queries

**Two Types of Caching:**
1. **Media Entity Cache** - Enhanced metadata stored within media documents (initially movie data from jellyfin - see data/example data/example_movie_data.py) the point being : jellyfin fields should be enough input to enrich from, whether movie fields or tv fields or book fields
2. **Concept Expansion Cache** - Reusable NLP results (ConceptNet expansions, LLM responses) to avoid duplicate API calls

## What to Preserve/Rebuild ‚úÖ

These are the core architectural patterns and infrastructure that work well and should be recreated:

- **Plugin Architecture** - Dynamic loading, hot-reload, hardware-adaptive plugin system
- **Redis Queue System** - Hardware-aware task distribution and queue management
- **Hardware Config** - Resource management and hardware detection
- **Environment Setup** - Proper dependency management, environment variables, development setup
- **MongoDB Integration** - Document storage with rich metadata capabilities
- **NLP Tools Integration** - Pattern of integrating sklearn, Duckling, Spacey, sutime, Faiss, ConceptNet, Wordnet, Ollama, NLTK, Gensim, Heideltime within plugins
- **NLP Tools should centrally initialize** - all download packs (things like ("wordnet", "corpora/wordnet"), ("punkt", "tokenizers/punkt"), ("stopwords", "corpora/stopwords"), )
- **Procedural Enhancement Pattern** - Plugins that generate intelligent enhancements rather than using hard-coded rules
- **Metrics are sent to Prometheus/Grafana for as much as possible : plugins, api, searches etc etc etc**

## Plugin Architecture Details

### Core Plugin System Design
**Base Plugin Classes:**
- `BasePlugin` - Abstract base with resource requirements, health checks, safe execution
- `QueryEmbellisherPlugin` - For query enhancement/expansion 
- `EmbedDataEmbellisherPlugin` - For data enrichment during ingestion
- `FAISSCRUDPlugin` - For FAISS operations (future use)

**Key Plugin Features:**
- **Hardware-Adaptive** - Plugins declare resource needs (CPU, memory, GPU)
- **Hot-Reload** - File watcher detects changes, reloads without restart
- **Health Monitoring** - Each plugin reports health status and metrics
- **Safe Execution** - Timeout protection, error handling, resource checks
- **Configuration Support** - Plugin-specific config files (YAML/JSON)

**Plugin Execution Flow:**
1. Plugin declares resource requirements
2. System checks available hardware via hardware_config
3. Plugin executes with timeout and resource monitoring
4. Results include execution time, success status, metrics
5. Failures handled gracefully with fallback behavior

**Plugin Registry Pattern:**
- Automatic discovery of plugins in directory
- Registration with metadata (name, version, type)
- Dependency resolution between plugins
- Enable/disable plugins at runtime
- Performance metrics collection

**Example Plugin Structure:**
```python
class MyEnhancerPlugin(EmbedDataEmbellisherPlugin):
    @property
    def metadata(self) -> PluginMetadata:
        return PluginMetadata(
            name="MyEnhancer",
            version="1.0.0",
            plugin_type=PluginType.EMBED_DATA_EMBELLISHER
        )
    
    @property
    def resource_requirements(self) -> PluginResourceRequirements:
        return PluginResourceRequirements(
            min_cpu_cores=1.0,
            preferred_memory_mb=500.0,
            requires_gpu=False
        )
    
    async def embellish_embed_data(self, data: Dict, context: PluginExecutionContext) -> Dict:
        # Procedural enhancement logic here
        # Check cache, call NLP tools, return enriched data
```

3. **Procedural Everything** - No lists, all generated from intelligence
4. **Media Agnostic** - Design works for any content type
5. **Graceful Degradation** - System works even when NLP services are down
6. **Performance Aware** - Cache and optimize for real-world usage
7. **FAIL FAST** - No fallbacks that mask real problems

## Key Files to Focus On

**Keep and Enhance:**
- Plugin architecture (`src/plugins/`)
- Hardware config (`src/shared/hardware_config.py`)
- MongoDB integration (`src/data/`)
- Environment setup (`pyproject.toml`, `config.py`)

**Replace with Intelligence:**
- Any file with hard-coded patterns
- Query analyzers with pattern matching
- Genre/keyword lists anywhere

**Build New:**
- Concept expansion cache
- Media-agnostic intelligence layer
- Procedural concept generation
