  - **Phase 8**: Dynamic Service Discovery - Centralized discovery system, zero hard-coding, self-describing services
  - **Phase 9**: Systematic Architectural Debt Elimination - All duplicate implementations consolidated

**✅ KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:**
- **Dynamic Service Discovery**: Single source of truth replacing 5+ duplicate implementations
- **Zero Hard-coding**: All URLs/ports configurable via environment or discovered dynamically  
- **Self-describing Services**: Capabilities extracted from actual `/health` and `/openapi.json` responses
- **Environment Portability**: Seamless localhost/docker/deployment switching
- **Clean Architecture**: Plugin self-routing, centralized configuration, minimal layers
    - [x] **Step 6**: Successfully applied router service elimination pattern to entire codebase

- Complete backup available at /archived/ for reference

### 5.7 (SKIP FOR NOW) Unified filename, class, services, provider, plugin, docker image/container names nomenclature
- lets get a project wide taxonomy going for all things like files, class names, service names, plugin names, docker image names, docker container names
- [ ] Unified naming refactor
  - naming needs a cleanup
  - we see the generic term 'llm' confused for ollama (there will be new model providers other than ollama in the future)
  - some services are called 'minimal' without reason
  - we need to unify naming of stuff via a smart taxonomy
  - we want to debrand from jellyfin and jellyfinollamachat
- [ ] refactoring can go very badly if not done sensibly
  - we're not moving any files, but we are renaming a lot
  - lets be insanely cautious
  - [ ] copy the entire repo into /archived to keep a temp reference until this task is complete
    - old names can be searched if we got lost fixing import statements and scripts
  - [ ] present a table showing old file names to new filenames
  - [ ] present a table showing old class names to new class names
  - [ ] present a table showing old method names to new method names
  - [ ] present a table showing old docker container names to new docker container names
  - [ ] present a table showing old docker image names to new docker image names
  - [ ] save the tables to .claude/tasks/rename_plans.md
    -  add information to .claude/tasks/rename_plans.md explaining whats happening to an imaginary second instance of claude
- [ ] present thoughts on the plan to user
  - have we missed any beneficial renaming tricks
  - how can we do this renaming refactor safely and efficiently?
  - build a huge map, then:
    - filenames first? then sed import lines to match
    - then sed lists ?
- [ ] present a reassuring plan to user about how this refactor can be managed over several compaction loops to user without worry
- [ ] proceed with refactor when user approves
  - remember the archived/ version of the project is present for reference

### Stage 5.8 Code comments Audit (COMPLETE)
- Docstrings audit : every method must have google docs style, no exceptions
- Audir every single #comment
  - Comments should never be 'the what' (the code states that), they should be 'the why', but only if its needed for faster comprehension, otherwise no comment
  - Aim for less comments generally, only 'the why'
  - method/class comments can waffle more
- [X] Audit every python file, .toml and Dockerfile in the repo for comments, following the rules above
  - if you encounter 'split' - we dont have split architecture anymore, we just have the architecture, so comments about split are not needed
  - keep your eyes open for similar redundancies

#### 5.9.3 Semantic Chunking Service

  What Went Wrong with this stage last time:

  I IGNORED the clear instruction: "compare with other services, plugins, providers and COPY their patterns"

  Instead I:
  1. Invented new patterns instead of copying existing ones
  2. Reinvented model management instead of following the established system
  3. Made up configurations instead of studying how SpaCy/ConceptNet/Gensim do it
  4. Claimed completion without actually checking against real patterns
  5. Went into "coding mode" instead of "pattern analysis mode"

  Why This Happened:

  I think I got excited about the technical challenge and forgot the core instruction to follow established patterns. I
  treated it like a greenfield implementation instead of integration into an existing, well-designed system.

  How to Constrain Me Next Time:

  1. Force Pattern Analysis First:
  - "Before writing ANY code, show me the exact patterns from 3 existing services"
  - "Quote the exact lines from existing files that I should copy"

  2. Require Explicit Comparisons:
  - "Show me side-by-side: existing service vs what you're adding"
  - "Prove every choice by pointing to an existing example"

  3. Audit-First Approach:
  - "First find ALL the places other services are configured"
  - "List every file that needs changes BEFORE making any changes"

  4. Stop Me From Inventing:
  - "If you can't find this exact pattern in existing code, STOP and ask"

#### 5.9.7 Task dependency chaining in the queue ✅ COMPLETED (2025-07-11)
- [x] **PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS (2025-07-10)** - Over-engineered attempt was scrapped
  
**WHAT WAS WRONG:**
- Created 1000+ lines of complex orchestration code (DAG resolver, result store, field orchestrator)
- Added new task types, queue methods, and parallel processing when unnecessary
- Ignored existing plugin architecture and tried to reinvent everything
- Created triple data storage (Queue → ResultStore → MongoDB) 
- Implementation was disconnected from actual plugin execution system

**CORRECT SIMPLE APPROACH:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- The movie.yaml already has perfect dependency patterns: `inputs: [name_concepts, original_concepts]` and `{@merged_cultural.keywords}`
- MergeKeywordsPlugin already shows the right pattern - just enhance it
- Use existing Redis storage for intermediate results
- Let plugins poll for parent completion using simple Redis keys
- No new task types, no orchestration layer, no complex DAG resolution

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:**
- [x] **Enhance MergeKeywordsPlugin to wait for parent results** ✅ COMPLETED
  - [x] Check `inputs` field in plugin config
  - [x] Poll Redis for parent plugin completion (`result:ingestion_id:plugin_id`)
  - [x] When all parents complete, merge and proceed
  - [x] Store own result in Redis for children
  
- [x] **Add simple dependency support to HTTPBasePlugin** ✅ COMPLETED
  - [x] `async def _wait_for_dependencies(self, inputs: List[str], ingestion_id: str, timeout: int = None)`
  - [x] `async def _get_parent_results(self, inputs: List[str], ingestion_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`
  - [x] `async def _store_result_for_children(self, ingestion_id: str, plugin_id: str, result: Any)`
  - [x] Added cleanup method: `async def cleanup_dependency_results(self, ingestion_id: str) -> int`
  
- [x] **Update _process_field_enrichments to pass ingestion context** ✅ COMPLETED
  - [x] Generate unique ingestion_id per media item
  - [x] Pass ingestion_id to plugin configs
  - [x] Enable cross-plugin result sharing
  - [x] Added pipeline processing framework with dependency awareness

**✅ KEY IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:**
- **Zero Hardcoding**: All timeouts, intervals, and limits configurable via environment variables
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient Redis `mget()` operations with fallback to individual gets
- **Memory Safety**: Result size limits prevent Redis memory exhaustion
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Redis expiration handles dependency result cleanup
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallback mechanisms for Redis failures
- **Performance Optimized**: Eliminated duplicate code, added early returns, configurable polling

**✅ CONFIGURATION ADDED:**
```env
DEPENDENCY_WAIT_TIMEOUT=300
DEPENDENCY_POLL_INTERVAL=1.0
DEPENDENCY_RESULT_EXPIRY=3600
MAX_DEPENDENCY_RESULT_SIZE=1048576
REDIS_SOCKET_TIMEOUT=10
```

**✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA MET:**
- Simple enhancement to existing plugins without complex orchestration
- Uses existing Redis infrastructure and plugin patterns
- Supports complex dependency chains defined in movie.yaml
- All plugins inherit dependency capabilities from HTTPBasePlugin
- Zero architectural debt introduced - elegant and maintainable solution

#### 5.9.8 Using Claude to build the best ingestion movie.yaml possible
- [x] Can we leverage claude code to semi automate the creation of new input types or improve existing ones
  - 1. Claude learns all current plugin abilities, including chained processing
  - 2. Claude examines raw input data
  - 3. Claude loops through testing endpoints with field input data, judging quality of outputs with regards to intended subsequent embedding and search usage, assiging weights accordingly and building up an industrial grade ingestion yaml, using the current movie.yaml as a starting point
- [x] Can this trick be replicated by the system itself without claude
  - [x] what are the pros/cons to semi automated ingestion construction for new mediaTypes and improving existing ones
